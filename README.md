# Text Encryption and Decryption Program
This Python script allows you to encrypt and decrypt text using the Fernet symmetric encryption algorithm from the cryptography library.

## Features

- Encrypt any text message using a generated encryption key.
- Decrypt the encrypted message back to its original form using the same key.

## Installation

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).
2. Install the required dependencies by running the following command:
pip install cryptography
## Usage

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the script in your terminal or command prompt.
3. Run the script using the following command:

Replace `encryption_script.py` with the name of the Python file containing the encryption code.
4. Follow the on-screen instructions to encrypt and decrypt text messages.

## Note

- Keep the encryption key secure, as it is used for both encryption and decryption.
- Do not share the encryption key with anyone who should not have access to the encrypted data.
